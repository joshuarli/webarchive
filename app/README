some weird pages

https://www.huckmag.com/article/kai-fusayoshi-reflects-on-a-life-shooting-the-streets-of-kyoto

with singlefile, you need to artificially scroll down a bit to preserve the page
otherwise it'll trip the next page mechanism

--load-deferred-images-dispatch-scroll-event doesn't work for it
we might have to tell the underlying chromedriver to scroll a little
